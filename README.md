# GameDesignAssignment2

To run this code (note that a decent chunk was given as the initial project, although the assignment had me work with almost all of the 
code/understand it) just download the love files and move them into this project folder (the folder with main.lua) and drag main.lua into 
love.exe. I believe when you download love, it comes with a main.lua file... delete this of course.

I used this API to get the movies (the one suggested originally now charges money): https://developers.themoviedb.org/

## What does this app do?

It simply loads two screens through a tab bar menu: a home screen where users can search for movies, and a settings screen. The home screen uses a stack navigator to allow the user to search for things (so there is a search results screen and a movie screen for a particular movie that is selected). Users search for a movie by title and results load that they can click on, which gives them more details.
