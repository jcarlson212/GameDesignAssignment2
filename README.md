# GameDesignAssignment2

To run this code (note that a decent chunk was given as the initial project, although the assignment had me work with almost all of the 
code/understand it) just download the love files and move them into this project folder (the folder with main.lua) and drag main.lua into 
love.exe. I believe when you download love, it comes with a main.lua file... delete this of course.
